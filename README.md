# Full Stack Developer Coding Test

Welcome to the coding test for the **Full Stack Developer** role. This repository contains two challenges:

1. **React Task Manager** (for web development).
2. **React Native User List** (for mobile development).

You are required to complete both tasks within the provided timeline. These challenges will assess your proficiency with React, React Native, Redux, and advanced development practices.

## React Task Manager

### Objective

Build a task management application using React hooks and Redux.

### Requirements

1. **State Management (Redux):**

   - Use Redux for global state to manage a list of tasks (id, title, priority, completed).

2. **Features:**
   - Add, edit, delete, and toggle task completion.
   - Filter tasks by:
     - Priority (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`).
   - Persist tasks in `localStorage`.

---

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct use of React hooks and Redux.
- Code structure and readability.
- Full functionality with filters, persistence, and editing.

---

## React Native User List

### Objective

Build a user list application using EXPO, optimized for performance and scalability.

### Requirements

1. **State Management (Redux):**

   - Manage user data fetched from the API.

2. **API Integration:**

   - Use `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` to fetch user data.
   - Store fetched users in Redux.
   - Implement offline support: Cache the fetched data using a library like AsyncStorage.

3. **FlatList Optimization:**

   - Use FlatList to render a list of users.

4. **Features:**

   - Display user data (`name`, `email`, `address`) in a reusable `UserCard`.
   - Search bar to filter users by name.
   - Pagination: Add a "Load More" button to fetch additional users.

5. **Data Transformation:**
   - Combine API `address` fields into a single string (`street, city, zipcode`).

---

### Evaluation Criteria

- Efficient use of `FlatList` and performance optimization.
- Proper Redux and API integration.
- Clean, reusable code for components like `UserCard`.
- Correct use of local storage
